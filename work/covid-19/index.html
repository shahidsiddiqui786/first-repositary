            <p class="ans" id="ans1">Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.</p>
          <hr>
            <h4 class="qus" id="qus2">What is a Covid-19?<i id="icon2" class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></h4>
            <p class="ans" id="ans2">COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a pandemic affecting many countries globally.</p>
          <hr>
            <h4 class="qus" id="qus3">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?<i id="icon3" class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></h4>
            <p class="ans" id="ans3">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are at higher risk of developing serious illness. However anyone can catch COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>
          <hr>
            <h4 class="qus" id="qus4">What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms and when should I seek medical care?<i id="icon4" class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></h4>
            <p class="ans" id="ans4">If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.<br>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.&nbsp; Seek medical help.&nbsp; When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distance from other
		    people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.<br>Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider in advance, so he can direct you to the right health facility.</p>
          <hr>
          <h4 class="qus" id="qus5">What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?<i id="icon5" class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></h4>
            <p class="ans" id="ans5">If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.<br>Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease. In these cases, it is best to stay at home. 
			<br>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice. <br>If you do <strong>not</strong> live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
			<br><br>If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test)  self-isolate for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as a precautionary measure &ndash; it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious after they have recovered. Follow national advice on self-isolation.</p>

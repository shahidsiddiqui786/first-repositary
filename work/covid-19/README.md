# Selection-Git-Repo
A Repository made to act as a placeholder in Web Development Wing, GeekHaven, IIITA

# The process at a glance

Note the process is subject to change without notice.
The following events would occur in sequence:
1. A form will be floated where students would be required to fill their following details; Name, Roll Number, git username, opencode info (if Applicable), skill set and link to the Selection Git Repo (SGR at ). The SGR will be made by me either on my GitHub account or the GeekHaven one. The prerequisite for filling the form will be 
-	Fork the SGR.
-	Clone it in their local system.
-	Make a basic webpage (the theme is COVID-19), that uses all the three basic frontend technologies i.e., HTML, CSS, JS. Of course, the page can be basic since every web developer must know a basic of all the three languages above but an expertise on the three is not an absolute requirement.
-	Push the changes to their SGRs.
-	Their respective SGR must be private and the coordinators should be added as collaborators. 
-	And the link to their SGRs is needed in their respective forms.
The SGR would be the primary mode for communication throughout the selection process. This process will ensure that every applicant has a basic knowledge of the frontend part. Again, this process would require only essential skills advanced skills would not be checked here.
